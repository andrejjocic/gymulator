[comment]: <> (a topic by a group's own choice; this should have a clear foundation based on existing research - present a 10 sentence paragraph explaining the problem that is supported by at least two scientific references.)

## Starting point
- [Gym Layout Modeling and Optimization](http://m.growingscience.com/beta/msl/5347-gym-layout-modeling-and-optimization.html)
- [A review on crowd simulation and modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070320300242?via%3Dihub)

## Plan

We will be tackling the problem of *gym layout optimisation*.
A common occurence in gyms at peak hours is over-crowding of popular equipment and lots of wandering around searching for a free machine.
Through simulating gym-goer behavior, we aim to identify the most effective arrangement of exercise equipment to improve the flow, accessibility, and overall customer satisfaction.
Our goal is to offer practical insights for gym owners, managers, and designers seeking to optimize their facility layout for the benefit of their clients and business success.

### Milestones
- **20th of November, 2023**: formulated model of gym-goer behaviour
- **18th of December, 2023**: simulations done
- **8th January, 2024**: simulation analysis done
